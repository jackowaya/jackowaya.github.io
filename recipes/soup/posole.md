This recipe is an ongoing attempt to adapt posole/pozole for the instant pot and for beans instead of meat.
This makes a lot. At least 8 servings, and it's fairly thick, nearly a stew. I think a smaller can of hominy + half pound beans + removing the water (leaving broth) might be better.

# Ingredients
* 3 oz of guajillo and/or new mexico chili peppers. Reduce for mild spice.
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 6 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
* 1 tablespoon ground cumin
* 1/2 cup (4 ounces) tomato paste
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 pound dry pinto or other beans, rinsed and drained. Have used black eyed peas as well
* 1 can (29 ounces) hominy, rinsed and drained. Or equivalent dry hominy
* 32 ounces (4 cups) vegetable broth
* 2 cups water
* 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, divided
* 1 lime (try 2 next time)
* Recommended garnishes: sliced avocado, shredded green cabbage, chopped radish, lime wedges, chopped jalapeño

# Steps
1. Cut off the stem ends of the chilis and remove as many seeds as possible. Rinse them and pat them dry.
2. Turn the instant pot on sautee medium. Toast the chilis in the dry pan, pressing them flat with a spatula for a few seconds until fragrant, then flip them over and press them again for a few seconds. Remove the toasted chilis and set them aside for now.
3. In the same pot (still over medium heat), warm the olive oil until shimmering.
Add the garlic and cumin and cook until fragrant while stirring, about 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and cook, while stirring, for 1 minute.
4. Add the toasted chili peppers, bay leaf, beans, vegetable broth and water. If you have dry hominy, add it here. Cook on high pressure for 35 minutes, then let vent naturally for 15 minutes
5. Remove the bay leaf from the soup and discard it. Remove the chilis and blend with some of the water, reserving this to adjust spiciness of the soup. Add hominy if you did not use dry. Return to sautee if the soup is too thin or warm otherwise.
6. Stir the cilantro and lime into the soup. Taste, and add more salt, lime juice, or blended chili. For extra richness, add a little splash of olive oil and stir it in.
7. Serve and garnish
