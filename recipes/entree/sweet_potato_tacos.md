**Active time:** 25 minutes

**Servings:** 6

# Ingredients:

* 1 1/2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch cubes
* 4 Tbsp olive oil, divided
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp paprika
* 1/4 tsp ground coriander
* 1/8 - 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
* 1 (14.5) oz can black beans, rinsed and drained
* 1 cup frozen yellow corn (preferably roasted), thawed and drained (it's fine to just throw beans and corn in a colander and rinse them together)
* 3 Tbsp honey
* 3 Tbsp fresh lime juice
* 2 Tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
* Corn or flour tortillas
* Romaine lettuce or purple cabbage, cotija or feta cheese, diced avocados, fresh salsa or pico de gallo and hot sauce (optional)

# Directions:
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Line a baking sheet with foil then place sweet potatoes on foil. Drizzle with 3 Tbsp olive oil and toss to evenly coat. Sprinkle evenly with cumin, paprika, coriander, cayenne pepper and season lightly with salt and pepper to taste then toss to evenly coat. Bake in preheated oven 15 - 20 minutes until tender, removing from oven and tossing once halfway through baking.
3. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, heat remaining 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add garlic and sautee for 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low, add in drained black beans, corn, honey and lime juice. Heat until warmed through. Toss in roasted sweet potatoes and cilantro. Serve over warm tortillas with desired toppings.
