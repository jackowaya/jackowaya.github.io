Refried Beans

**Total time:** 1 hour

**Active time:** 10 minutes

**Servings:** 8

# Ingredients:

* 1/2 pound dry pinto, mayacoba, or other medium beans. Roughly 1 cup
* 1 tbsp butter or extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 chipotles in adobo, roughly chopped + 1tsp of adobo from the chipotles. 2 = medium spice
* 3 cloves garlic chopped (about 1 tablespoon)
* 4 cups vegetable stock divided
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* Experiment: 1 tbsp tomato paste
* Experiment: ½ tsp smoked paprika (definitely do this if you leave out chipotles)

# Directions:
1. Place the pinto beans in a large colander. Thoroughly rinse them. Pick the beans over, removing any damaged or clearly misshapen beans and discarding them. Set the rinsed beans aside.
2. Turn a 6-quart (or larger) Instant Pot to SAUTE. Add the oil. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic. Add the garlic and let cook just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the chipotles and adobo and cook for 30 more seconds. Add a few splashes of chicken stock and scrape along the bottom of the pot to remove any stuck-on bits of food (this will prevent a BURN warning). Add the remaining stock, water, bay leaves, salt, cumin, oregano, cayenne, and the rinsed and drained beans. Lightly stir to combine.
3. Seal the Instant Pot. Cook on HIGH (manual) for 35 minutes. When the 35 minutes of pressure cooking has finished, let the pressure release naturally for 25 minutes. Vent to release any remaining pressure. Carefully open the lid. The beans will be very liquidy.
4. Discard the bay leaves. For milder beans discard some parts of the chipotles Reserve 2 cups of the bean cooking liquid in a bowl or measuring cup, then drain the remainder. Return the beans to the pot. Add about 1/2 cup of the reserved liquid. With an immersion blender (or by hand with a potato masher), puree the beans until they reach your desired consistency, adding some of the reserved liquid as needed. (You can also scoop the beans into a blender in batches and puree them that way—be sure to let the beans cool somewhat first so that they do not splatter). Taste and adjust seasoning as desired. Sprinkle with any desired toppings, serve, and enjoy!
5. Before storing the beans, add more liquid. They tend to dry out over time.
